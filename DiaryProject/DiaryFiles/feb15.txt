I'm glad I'm taking way less credits next quarter, holy shit I don't like taking this many credits.
tbh this has been a cool experience kind of testing my limits but at the same time fuck this, it makes me wanna drop out of school.
The amount of work I have from school, the way midterms are spread out, plus hyperloop makes things very hectic and I feel pretty overwhelmed.
I really want more time to spend on python research, maybe even some more music stuff, and i just wanna relax and play some games too.
Next quarter, though, I'll be living in at the house and I'll be taking way less credits so hopefully I'll have time for that kind of stuff.
Valentines day just passed and honestly felt a lot less lonely than I thought I would, I kind of didn't really care much.
Of course, it sucks but I do want time to improve and work on myself and getting into a relationship doesn't feel like a priority to me right now anyways.
Gaming chair comes in tomorrow, I really want 3D world again, and schools just chuggin along so I'm feeling ok.
Not a whole lot going on lately, but it has been snowing this weekend so I got to hang out with my family and play in the snow.
Life's not too bad right now, but I definitely wish I got to talk to more people and have more friends, it's making me miss high school when I want to look forwards to college instead.
