Today's been a pretty good day. I learned a lot about python for the past couple days so I finally got my diary program to work!!!
Since the diary program is up and running I guess this is the start of my diary. For my future pans, I plan on making a GUI for my diary so it's easier to access and looks cleaner.
That way I can also get more coding experience!!
I've really been into coding lately, and even though I'm not great at it and I don't have a lot of experience, I still enjoy it.
I mean, what are classes? methods? All this terminology is kind of confusing, but I'm starting to get the hang of it i think. Hopefully all of this saves lol
I mean, this program is kind of a work in progress so if none of this saves I'd be PISSED.
Ok,not really cause this took like 2 minutes to write. The diary entry, not the code :| But yeah, school has been pretty dull, Hyperloop is confusing/up in the air???
I don't really know where it's heading at this pace honestly, but it's whatever I get a good resume builder either way.
I think I'm gonna start focusing my attention on internships, contacting people/networking, and looking into what major I want to apply to.
I mean, seriously, I've been looking around for what i want to do and I've been jumping around so much.
From pharmacy to med school to chemical engineering, to electrical, and now I'm thinking of CSE? I think I'm retarted LOL
But ya know, it's all good. I've been having a good time with my family and friends. COVID and isolation made me go a little nuts at times, but I think I've settled on a good path now.
I really understand that my brother and parents are there to support me, I've got a good idea of what i want to do going forward, and I've found a work-related thing like programming that I enjoy.
Things are looking up so I'm not too worried about the future. Until tomrrow, me :)
